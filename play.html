            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6><p> No, Mr. Bauer's out yet.</p><p>[_She listens through the
                transmitter._]</p><p> Thank you, Mrs. Mohler.</p><p> [_Another pause._]</p><p> I'll tell him
                just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.</p>
                    <p> [MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing.</p> Grocer boy rushes into
                     basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
                     BAUER'S _door and looks in_.</p>
                
                
                <h6> LANE.</h6><p> Say--where's the boss?</p>
                
                <h6> MRS. BAUER.</h6><p> He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?</p>
                
                     <p>[_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._</p>
                
                <h6>LANE.</h6><p> Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
                groceries for Sawyers.</p>
                
                <h6> MRS. BAUER.</h6><p> [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
                which hangs beside the door._]</p> <p> Here.</p>
                
                <h6> LANE.</h6><p> What's the matter?</p>
                
                <h6> MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Dully._]</p><p> Huh?</p>
                
                <h6> LANE.</h6><p> [_Significantly._]</p><p> Oh, I know.</p>
                
                <h6> MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>What you know?</p>
                
                <h6> LANE.</h6><p> About the boss.</p><p>[MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.]</p><p> Heard your
                friends across the street talkin'.</p>
