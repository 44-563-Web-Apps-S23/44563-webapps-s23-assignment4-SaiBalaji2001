        <h3> THE LAST STRAW

            BY
            
            BOSWORTH CROCKER </h3>
            <p>MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
                transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
                just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
                
                     [MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
                     basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
                     BAUER'S _door and looks in_.
                
                
                LANE. Say--where's the boss?
                
                MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?
                
                     [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._
                
                LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
                groceries for Sawyers.
                
                MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
                which hangs beside the door._] Here.
                
                LANE. What's the matter?
                
                MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?
                
                LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.
                
                MRS. BAUER. What you know?
                
                LANE. About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your
                friends across the street talkin'.
                
                MRS. BAUER. [_Bitterly._] Friends!
                
                LANE. Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid
                up to get him pinched.
                
                MRS. BAUER. [_Absently._] Was she an old maid?
                
                LANE. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [_waves his
                hand_]--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.
                
                MRS. BAUER. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
                one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.
                
                LANE. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
                dog.
                
                MRS. BAUER. He don't do nothin' of the sort--jus' drives it 'way from
                the garbage-pails--that's all. We coulda had that dog took up long
                ago--they ain't got no license. But Fritz--he's so easy--he jus' takes
                it out chasin' the dog and hollerin'.
                
                LANE. That ain't no way. He ought to make the dog holler--good and
                hard--once; then it'd keep out of here.</p>
